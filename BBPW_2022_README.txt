README

Replication package for Berkouwer, Biscaye, Puller, & Wolfram (2022). Disbursing emergency relief through utilities: Evidence from Ghana. Journal of Development Economics.

Folder contents:
1. BBPW_2022_GhanaCovidRelief_data.dta: a Stata data file containing the data used in the analysis
2. BBPW_2022_GhanaCovidRelief_code.do: a Stata do file containing all the code used in the analysis

Directories: 
The do file includes a single line of code to set the local directory where the data file is saved. In that same folder, the user should create subfolders titled “graphs” and “tables” where the output will be saved.

Outputs:
The do file outputs all figures and tables included in the published paper (including the online appendix), with the exception of Table A1 which was created manually by comparing summary statistics across different household surveys. Figures are output as PDFs and tables are output as tex files.
